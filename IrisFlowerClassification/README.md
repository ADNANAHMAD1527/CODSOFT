## Project Description

This project focuses on classifying iris flowers into three species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica using machine learning techniques on the Iris dataset. The dataset consists of 150 samples, each described by four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. The workflow begins with data preprocessing, which involves cleaning and preparing the dataset for analysis. Following this, exploratory data analysis (EDA) is conducted to visualize the data and understand the relationships among the features.

Next, various machine learning algorithms are considered for model selection, including Logistic Regression, Decision Tree and Support Vector Machine (SVM). Each model is trained and evaluated to determine its performance based on metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Finally, hyperparameter tuning is performed to optimize the model's performance, ensuring high classification accuracy. Overall, this project provides a comprehensive approach to effectively classifying iris flowers using machine learning techniques.
