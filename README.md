# CodSoft

As part of my internship at CodSoft, I am tasked with developing several machine learning models across different domains. Below are the details of the projects:

### Task 1: Iris Flower Classification

This project involves training a model to classify Iris flowers into three species using sepal and petal measurements. The goal is to accurately predict the species based on the features provided in the Iris dataset.

### Task 2: Movie Rating Prediction

In this task, I am building a regression model to predict movie ratings based on various features, including genre, director, and actors. This project aims to analyze and understand how these factors influence movie ratings.

### Task 3: Sales Prediction

For this project, I am developing a model to forecast sales using factors such as advertising expenditure and target audience segmentation. The objective is to create an effective model that can help businesses understand sales dynamics and improve decision-making.

These tasks showcase my ability to apply machine learning techniques to real-world problems and contribute to the overall objectives of the internship at CodSoft.
