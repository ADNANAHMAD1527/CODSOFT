## Project Description

This project aims to predict movie ratings using machine learning techniques on a movie dataset. The dataset contains various features related to movies, such as genre, director, cast, and user reviews, which are essential for accurately predicting ratings. The workflow begins with data preprocessing, where the dataset is cleaned and prepared for analysis, ensuring that it is ready for modeling.

Following this, exploratory data analysis (EDA) is conducted to visualize trends and relationships among the different features, providing valuable insights into the data. Machine learning algorithm  Linear Regression is evaluated to select the most effective model for predicting ratings.

The selected model undergoes training and is evaluated to assess its performance. Additionally, hyperparameter tuning is performed to optimize the model, aiming to improve accuracy and reliability in predictions. Overall, this project provides a structured approach to effectively predicting movie ratings using machine learning techniques.
