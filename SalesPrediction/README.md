## Project Description

This project focuses on predicting sales using  machine learning technique in Python, utilizing an advertisement dataset from Kaggle. The dataset includes features such as product categories, pricing, promotional activities, and historical sales data, which are essential for accurate predictions. The workflow begins with data preprocessing, where the dataset is cleaned and prepared for analysis.

Following this, exploratory data analysis (EDA) is conducted to visualize trends and relationships among the features. Machine learning algorithms, including Linear Regression is evaluated to identify the best model for sales prediction.

The selected model is trained and assessed to evaluate its performance. Hyperparameter tuning is also performed to improve accuracy and reliability. Overall, this project provides a structured approach to effectively predicting sales using Python and machine learning techniques.
